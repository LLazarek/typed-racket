# Summary

This RFC adds two new languages to Typed Racket (TR): shallow and optional.
These language use the same static types as TR to compile a program, but have
different opinions about what types mean when a program runs.

Here is a quick comparison. To ground the discussion, let's say we have
the declaration `(: str* (Listof String))` in typed code. The value of `str*`
can come from untyped code, so the question "what do types mean?" really asks
what untyped values can enter this variable, and what values lead to a run-time
error.

1. Normal `#lang typed/racket` offers _Deep_ types. The whole static type means
   something at run-time. For `str*`, the value is guaranteed to be a list
   of only strings.

2. New `#lang typed/racket/shallow` gives weaker, _Shallow_ types. Only
   the outer-most part of the type, the constructor, means something. For
   `str*`, the value is guaranteed to be a list, but there is no guarantee
   about the elements. That said, if our typed code takes `(car str*)` then
   the result has type `String` and is guaranteed to be a string --- if the
   list had a bad element, the program would raise an error at the `car`.

3. New `#lang typed/racket/optional` is like the `no-check` languages, but
   actually type-checks the code. These _Optional_ types mean nothing at
   run-time. The value of `str*` could be anything.

For the rest of this RFC, the focus is on Shallow types and how we plan to
implement them using the _Transient_ semantics. The idea with Transient is
to rewrite all typed code with simple assertions about the shape of values.

By contrast to Transient, normal TR gets Deep types through the Guarded
(aka Natural) semantics. The idea with Guarded is to keep a strict boundary
between typed and untyped code with flat contracts, chaperones, and
impersonators.

The Optional idea is simple: use the TR type checker at compile-time and normal
`#lang racket` behavior at run-time.

Note: Optional is here, rather than a separate RFC, to test that PR #948 has a
flexible way to pick different meannings for types. I'm hoping code that works
for 3 ideas will be able to handle other ideas if needed.


# Motivation

Deep types are expensive and difficult to enforce. Shallow types via the
Transient semantics are often cheaper and always easier to check. Changing a
program to use Shallow types may give two immediate benefits:

  S1. A program should run faster if it mixes typed and untyped code.

  S2. Some type-correct programs that cannot run in Deep can run in Shallow.

That said, Deep types still have benefits over Shallow types:

  D1. When a mixed typed/untyped program goes wrong, Deep types blame a
      precise boundary between a typed module and an untyped one.

  D2. Mostly-typed Deep programs often run faster than untyped, but Shallow
      programs run slower with more types.

Points S1 and S2 motivate Shallow. Points D1 and D2 motivate a mix of Deep
and Shallow. The goal is to offer both as `#lang`s that can interact.

### (S1) Shallow types can be faster

These comments are about Shallow types as implemented by Transient.

#### Example 1 : read-only data

When an untyped list flows into Deep code, the whole list gets a
runtime check. When the same list flows to Shallow code, there is a simple
`list?` check only; other checks come as needed. So, simple list functions
should run much faster.

  ```
  (: get-first (-> (Listof String) String))
  (define (get-first str*)
    (car str*))
  ```

If `get-first` lives in a `#lang typed/racket/deep` module, every call walks
the whole list. But if `get-first` is in a `#lang typed/racket/shallow` module,
only 1 element gets checked.


### Example 2 : mutable data

When an untyped vector flows into Deep code, it gets wrapped in a chaperone
to make sure that its future behavior matches the type. When a vector flows
into Shallow code, there is one `vector?` check; there is no wrapper, and
element checks only happen when needed.

Here is a very simple example:

  ```
  (: vector-id (-> (Vectorof Real) (Vectorof Real)))
  (define (vector-id v)
    v)
  ```

With Deep types, the incoming vector gets wrapped in a chaperone. All future
uses of this vector need to go through the chaperone --- so those future uses
suffer indirection and checking costs.

With Shallow types, this code has one `vector?` check. The vector `v` does
not get a wrapper.


### Example 3 : functions

Deep types wrap and chaperone functions (just like mutable data). Shallow
types spot-check the result of function calls, but do not create wrappers.

Here's another simple example, a typed wrapper around the `racket/base` map
function:

  ```
  (: rmap (-> (-> Real Boolean) (Listof Real) (Listof Boolean)))
  (define (rmap f r*)
    (map f r*))
  ```

With Deep types, the function `f` gets a wrapper. When `map` uses this function,
the wrapper checks that `f` gets a `Real` and returns a `Boolean`.

With Shallow types, there are two checks: does `f` look good? does `r*` look
good? These checks are basically `procedure?` and `list?`. That's all!


### (S2) Shallow types can allow new interactions

Deep types need to use wrappers to check/protect mutable values. Every kind of
mutable value in Racket needs a custom kind of wrapper. But some wrappers do
not exist yet ... so TR conservatively rejects some programs.

For example, mpairs are mutable and do not have a wrapper. So the following
"good" program gives a runtime error with Deep types:

  ```
  #lang racket

  (module t typed/racket
    (: add-mpair (-> (MPairof Real Real) Real))
    (define (add-mpair mp)
      (+ (mcar mp) (mcdr mp)))
    (provide add-mpair))

  (require 't)

  (add-mpair (mcons 2 4))
  ;; Type Checker: could not convert type to a contract;
  ;; contract generation not supported for this type
  ```

Shallow types (via Transient) can run the program, no problem. For Shallow type
safety, the typed function checks `mpair?` of its input and `real?` after the
getter functions.


Another example is syntax. Syntax objects can contain mutable values, and
so syntax objects need a wrapper to safely travel across Deep code.
Implementing these wrappers would require changes to basic parts of Racket,
including the macro expander.


### (D1) Deep types give better errors

Thanks to the heavy checking and careful use of wrappers, Deep types give a
strong guarantee: every communication between typed and untyped code will
either match the types or halt the program. In other words, there is no way
that untyped code can sneak a bad value into typed code.

Because of this Deep-types guarantee (called "complete monitoring" in the
papers), TR can blame one _correct_ source-code boundary when a check fails.
The boundary is correct in the sense that something is definitely wrong:
either the untyped code produced a bad value, or typed code has a bad
expectation.

Shallow types cannot always blame a single boundary because they don't always
fully guard a boundary. Let's go back to lists; here is a typed function that
looks at part of a list and passes it on:

  ```
  (: spot-check (-> (Listof Symbol) (Listof Symbol)))
  (define (spot-check sym*)
    (cons (cadr sym*) (cons (car sym*) (cddr sym*))))
  ```

With Shallow types, there is no guarantee that the result is a list of symbols.
Suppose it's not --- that we start with a list `'(A B "C")` and it crosses
several typed/untyped boundaries before typed code finally realizes the 3rd
element is a string. Unless we keep a record of everywhere the list has been,
there is no way to point back to the first `spot-check` call.

Shallow-type blame gets even worse when we have typed claims about untyped
libraries. In the example below, the types in the middle incorrectly say
that the library on top sends numbers to its callback. The client on the
bottom assumes the types are right --- and if the types are Shallow, they
do not protect the client from unexpected input:

  ```
  #lang racket

  (module library racket
    (define (sender f)
      (f "hello"))
    (provide sender))

  (module types typed/racket/shallow
    (require/typed/provide (submod ".." library)
      (sender (-> (-> Real Real) Real))))

  (module client racket
    (require (submod ".." types))
    (sender (lambda (n) (add1 n))))

  (require 'client)
  ;; Shallow => add1 contract violation
  ```


The blog post here shows that Shallow types can miss errors:

Section 2.3 of the paper behind that blog post talks about Shallow types cannot
pinpoint the origin of a type mixup:

### (D2) Adding types affects Deep and Shallow differently

Deep types check the boundaries between typed and untyped code. If there are
no boundaries, there are no checks.

Shallow types via Transient pre-emptively protect typed code. Every expression
in typed code might get compiled to have a check around it --- depending on
whether the code can receive untyped input.

Early experience with Deep and Shallow/Transient suggests a few general claims
about how adding types changes performance:

- Deep types can add a huge slowdown when typed and untyped code share
  mutable data.

- Deep types also enable optimizations. If there are no crippling typed/untyped
  boundaries in a program, typed code is often faster than untyped.

- Shallow types add a low, steady overhead as more code gets typed.

- Shallow types enable some optimizations, but these rarely outweigh the cost
  of the checks.

# Drawbacks and Alternatives
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Drawback: more languages = more choices = more ways to get confused.
And people may be surprised that typed-to-typed communication is still
 expensive (because Deep needs to protect itself against Shallow types).

One alternative is to keep trying to make TR faster.

Another is to implement Shallow types using wrappers instead of the Transient
strategy. With wrappers, interaction with TR should be faster. But doing may
require new contracts (or chaperones), and will prevent some typed/untyped
mixes that Transient allows (unless we can make new chaperones to allow them).

Overall, Transient seems like a great compromise to try first. If it somehow
fails, we can always deprecate and try a new language.


# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

> - Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience
>   have their community had?

Shallow types are in Reticulated Python and Grace.

Reticulated is the original home of the Transient semantics. Michael Vitousek
invented Transient; his dissertation talks about experiences (esp. Chap 4).

Grace has shallow checks that were inspired by Transient.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

PR #948 has a list of lower-level todo items.

Documentation. What should it include, and how should it be organized to
 introduce new TR languages.

> - What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
>   of this feature before stabilization?

1. How to insert checks everywhere. Today, RackUnit `test-case`s and
   `with-handlers` blocks are unsafe because they're marked as "ignored" by TR.
   There may be others. (2020-07-26)

2. What's the ideal check for every type?
   Should `(Listof T)` use `list?` or `(or/c null? pair?)`?
   Should `(-> Void Void)` use `procedure?` or
    `(and/c procedure? (procedure-arity-includes/c 1))`?
   So far I've gone for "complete" checks to help the programmer and TR
    optimizer, but if the cost is too high let's go simpler.

3. How to minimize the cost of each check, probably by avoiding `racket/contract`
   combinators.

> - What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
>   addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
>   RFC?

Below are 4 issues related to the transient semantics.


- How to add blame? For now, an error gives a failed check (value, type,
  srcloc) and a stack trace. Use regular to TR help debug runtime type errors.

- How to avoid redundant checks (via static/dynamic analysis)? For example, a
 function that takes the `car` of a pair twice currently pays 2 checks.

  ```
    (define (f (xy : (Pairor Real Real))) : Real
      (+ (car xy) (car xy))
  
      #;(+ (check real? (car xy)) (check real? (car xy))))
  ```


- How to trust full types? For now, certain identifiers are trusted. One example
  is `map`, which always returns a `list?` and doesn't need to be checked.
  One non-example is `negate`. Currently, the implementation can trust `negate`
  returns a function, but it can't trust that new function to return booleans.

- How to re-use library wrappers? A library wrapper, like `typed/pict`, is
  written in the normal TR language. Shallow types can re-use these definitions,
  but need to pay the full TR cost at the library boundary. Ideally, these
  library wrappers should be in a special language that chooses Deep/Shallow
  types based on the `require`-ing module ... but we need to make sure that's
  always safe.
