- [X] fsmoo/mbta/quadU/take5, object/sc and class/sc unsupported
- [X] synth, threadcell contract
- [X] acquire, cannot generate contract 2 cases of arity 1
- [X] acquire/dungeon/forth/zombie, sc->tag expected sc got void
- [X] sc->tag/c why return a static contract and not a contract? (issue with recursion?)
      yeah it's gotta be an sc because we're not ready to instantiate yet
- [X] fsm, expected (StructTypeTop ....) failed
- [X] plot build fails (see in-cycle.rkt test)
      opened issue in TR (), hacked-around for LD for now
      EDIT closed the TR issue, hack validated
- [X] make-typed-renaming needs 3 args but sometimes gets 2 ... how? (in-array.rkt)

- [ ] quadU errors in untyped and typed, by cadr
      error changed after revert x4:
        sc->tag/c: not implemented for (cons/sc (flat/sc symbol?) (cons/sc (listof/sc (cons/sc (flat/sc symbol?) #0=any/sc)) (listof/sc #0#)))
      error not fixed by removing rts provides

- [ ] morsecode/sieve/snake/tetris, very slow runtime (require-typed-check bug?)
      ... better now after checking "blessed" but heres now fully-typed vs ICPF worst-case
      morsecode : 4.45 vs 3.48
      sieve : 2.84 vs 1.69
      snake : 11.3 vs 6.7
      tetris : 1.2 vs 8.8
      zombie : 24x vs 20x
      ICFP should always be slower, but its not ... WTF snake & tetris!!!!!

- [ ] fsmoo (population) quadU (utils) quadT (core-types) forth (command) slow to compile
      even typed maybe

- [ ] unhygienic S require T identifier
      use contract-def/provide-property ?
