#lang typed/racket/base #:transient

;; Expected: transient-assert error
;;
;; With a similar program, we can end up passing a bad input to `cdr`,
;;  so transient functions need to be careful to protect themselves
;;  (untyped & typed need to take care too, of course).
;; But, I don't think we can end up with a bad op in transient code.
